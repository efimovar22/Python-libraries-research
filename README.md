# Python-libraries-research
This repository contains a research project focused on exploring various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. The project covers the following topics:

1. Numpy and Scipy: Notebook (1-numpy_and_scipy.ipynb) with research on the Numpy and Scipy libraries for numerical computing, scientific computing, and data analysis.

2. Pandas: Notebook (2-pandas.ipynb) with research on the Pandas library, which provides powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and data structures.

3. Matplotlib and Seaborn: Notebook (3-matplotlib_ans_seaborn.ipynb) with research on the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for creating static and interactive visualizations.

4. Plotly: Notebook (4-plotly.ipynb) with research on the Plotly library, which offers a powerful platform for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.

Feel free to explore the notebooks to learn more about these Python libraries and their capabilities for data analysis and visualization.
